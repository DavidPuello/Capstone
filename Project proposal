I will use React and node for the project. 

The front-end ui for the most part, is because it will display stock prices and values of stock

This will be a website

It will be a stock market search engine
People who are more into financial markets and stock traders

I have picked the yahoo Api stock data for my project

It will allow for searching a company, its stock price, market cap, and general information.
